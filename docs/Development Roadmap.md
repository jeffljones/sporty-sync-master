Development Roadmap

Below is a suggested multi-phase plan, starting with environment setup and leading to final launch. Adjust the timeline and task granularity to fit your team’s workflow.
Phase 1: Environment Setup & Core Data Model

    Initialize Supabase Project

        Configure DB with users, players, competitions, teams, team_members, matches.

        Enable RLS on these tables; define policies for INSERT/UPDATE so only the correct user can modify their own data.

    Create React App

        Install Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI.

        Configure basic routing (React Router).

    Configure Auth

        Integrate Supabase Auth for signup/login flows in React.

Milestone: Can register and log in as a new user, automatically creating a row in players.
Phase 2: Admin & Player Flows (Teams, Registration)

    Team Formation

        UI for Create Team and Join Team.

        Enforce roster size limits in the UI and DB triggers or RLS constraints.

    Locking Mechanism

        Admin button or auto-lock time to close team changes.

    Player Dashboard

        “My Tournaments” and “My Teams” lists.

        Minimal profile editing page.

Milestone: A user can create a team or join an existing team within a specific tournament, and the Admin can lock rosters.
Phase 3: Tournament Creation & Bracket Generation

    Admin Dashboard

        “Create New Tournament” form (date, location, format).

        “Generate Bracket” button with seeding logic for single/double elimination or round robin.

    Matches Table Population

        On bracket creation, auto-insert round 1 matches.

        For subsequent rounds, update winners in the bracket.

    Pickup Sessions (Optional if you want to address tournaments first):

        “Create Pickup Session” route.

        Check-in list and random team generator.

Milestone: Admin can create a tournament, finalize rosters, generate a bracket, and see the first matches appear.
Phase 4: Match Management & Score Reporting

    Match Listing UI

        For each match, show teams, scheduled time, current score, or final result.

    Score Input

        Admin or assigned roles can enter final scores (e.g., best of 3 sets or a single set).

    Bracket/Standings Updates

        Real-time or manual refresh to recalculate next rounds or pool standings.

Milestone: The bracket or standings update automatically when scores are entered. Players see the next opponent.
Phase 5: Refinements & Optional Features

    Real-Time Updates with Supabase Realtime (optional).

        Automatic bracket refresh for connected clients.

    Pickup Flow (if not done in Phase 3).

        “Random Team Shuffle,” multiple short matches, minimal scoreboard.

    UI Polishing & Responsiveness

        Ensure mobile-friendly layouts with Tailwind.

        Improve bracket visualization (possible third-party bracket library or custom components).

Milestone: A near-complete MVP with both tournament and pickup support, plus a refined UI and optional real-time scoreboard.
Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

    Integration Testing

        Confirm RLS policies are correct.

        Validate edge cases (e.g., a user tries to join a full roster).

    Staging Deployment

        Push to Netlify/Vercel with environment variables for Supabase keys.

    Beta Testing

        Gather feedback from actual users or your team members.

    Production Launch

        Move final environment variables to a secure location.

        Go live.

Milestone: Officially launch for real tournaments or pickup events.
6. Additional Considerations

    Security:

        Strict RLS ensuring only admins can create or modify tournaments and matches.

        Players can only see or edit their own data.

    Error Handling:

        Clear messages when rosters are at capacity, or if a user tries to register for a locked event.

    Performance:

        For large tournaments, bracket generation might need efficient queries.

        Basic indexes on foreign keys (e.g., team_id, player_id) are critical.

    Scalability:

        Supabase can scale for a moderate user base; advanced load testing is out of scope for MVP but can come later.

    Future Enhancements:

        Payment gateway, advanced stats, in-app chat, social logins, etc.

7. Conclusion

This technical document and roadmap combine all the details from the PRDs into one actionable plan. By following the proposed phases—beginning with environment/auth setup, moving into team and bracket functionality, and finishing with refinements and real-time updates—you’ll have a functional volleyball tournament and pickup platform that covers the core requirements:

    Players: Create/join teams, register for events, track personal stats.

    Admins: Set up new tournaments/pickup sessions, lock rosters, input scores, and manage brackets in real time.

By the end of these milestones, you should have a live MVP allowing real-world use for single-day volleyball tournaments and pickup games.
