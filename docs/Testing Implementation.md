Testing Overview

    Unit Tests (Frontend + Utility Functions)

        Focus: Individual React components and utility methods that don’t depend heavily on external services.

        Tools: Jest + React Testing Library.

        Purpose: Quickly validate core logic (e.g., user input handling, role checks) without needing a full environment.

    Integration Tests (Frontend ↔ Supabase)

        Focus: How your React app interacts with Supabase for auth, queries, and RLS-protected tables.

        Tools: Jest or Vitest with msw (Mock Service Worker) or a test Supabase project set up for staging.

        Purpose: Ensure that data flows (e.g., creating teams, joining rosters, updating matches) work as expected with minimal mocking.

    End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Full User Flows)

        Focus: Complete user journeys—for example, an Admin creating a tournament, a Player registering, brackets getting generated, etc.

        Tools: Cypress or Playwright.

        Purpose: Validate that features “just work” from the user perspective (UI clicks → DB changes → UI updates).

    Regression / Smoke Tests

        Focus: Quick checks on critical paths (login, team creation, bracket generation) after each deployment or major PR.

        Tools: Can reuse a subset of E2E tests in a “smoke test” suite.

        Purpose: Rapidly confirm that the major user flows are still functional.

    Performance or Load Tests (Optional / Future)

        Focus: Potential stress testing for large tournaments or many concurrent users.

        Tools: e.g. k6 or Locust if you anticipate high concurrency.

2. Testing Phase by Phase

Your Development Roadmap.md outlines distinct phases. Here’s how to weave testing into each one.
Phase 1: Environment Setup & Core Data Model

    Set up Jest + React Testing Library in your React app immediately.

    Write simple unit tests for any utility functions (e.g., form validation, data parsing).

    Validate basic Supabase Auth flows with integration tests:

        Example: A test that calls supabaseClient.signUp() and checks if a player row was created.

    Set up a skeleton E2E test that just visits your local dev environment, ensuring your test runner is properly configured.

Goal: Establish a stable test harness from day one.
Phase 2: Admin & Player Flows (Teams, Registration)

    Unit Tests:

        Components like <CreateTeamForm />, <JoinTeamButton />, etc.

        Check that validation and edge cases (e.g., “team at capacity”) pass.

    Integration Tests:

        Confirm that forming a team actually inserts rows in teams and team_members.

        Check RLS constraints: a user should not be able to join a locked team if the lock column is set.

    E2E Tests:

        A test that walks through: “Player logs in → Creates a new team → Logs out → Another player logs in → Joins that team.”

Goal: Ensure team formation and registration logic works in real usage scenarios.
Phase 3: Tournament Creation & Bracket Generation

    Unit Tests:

        Bracket utility functions (if you have a function that seeds or arranges teams in single-/double-elimination).

    Integration Tests:

        Validate that calling your bracket-generation function populates the matches table as expected.

        Test role-based restrictions (only Admin can “Generate Bracket”).

    E2E Tests:

        “Admin logs in → Creates tournament → Adds teams → Clicks ‘Generate Bracket’ → Verifies match data is created.”

Goal: Confidently ship new bracket features without breaking existing “join team” or auth flows.
Phase 4: Match Management & Score Reporting

    Unit / Integration Tests:

        Functions that update match scores or handle best-of-3 logic.

        Checks that only an Admin or an authorized “scorekeeper” can write final scores.

    E2E Tests:

        “Admin updates a match score → The bracket advances → Next round is visible in the UI.”

        “Players see new bracket status after a match is finalized.”

    Regression Tests:

        Re-run your core smoke suite to make sure team creation, registration, and bracket generation are all still solid.

Goal: Prove that updating scores doesn’t break prior phases (teams, rosters, bracket seeding).
Phase 5: Refinements & Optional Features

    Continuous Test Coverage:

        If you add real-time updates (Supabase Realtime), add coverage for that (e.g., E2E test that verifies scoreboard auto-updates or reloads).

        If you add pickup flows or random team assignment, create tests for the randomization routines (e.g., mocking Math.random() for stable test output).

    UI Snapshot Tests (optional):

        For rapidly changing UI components (e.g., bracket display), consider snapshot tests to catch accidental UI regressions.

Goal: Maintain a consistent test harness as more features (pickup sessions, skill-based matching) come online.
Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

    Run All Tests in CI/CD:

        On every pull request:

            Unit + Integration tests must pass.

            A subset of E2E “smoke tests” runs quickly to confirm major flows.

        On merges to main or release branches:

            Full E2E suite runs with a test environment.

    Staging Environment:

        Spin up a staging Supabase instance or use a dedicated schema for test data.

        Deploy your React app to a staging URL so the E2E runner can interact with a near-production environment.

    Beta / UAT:

        Have a small group test the app manually.

        Collect feedback on edge cases your automated tests might not cover.

Goal: Guarantee a tested, deployable artifact on every merge.
3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

    Use a Dedicated Supabase Project or Schema for Testing

        Avoid polluting production data.

        If you want to test advanced RLS scenarios, you can spin up ephemeral schemas or seed data before each test run.

    Mock External Services Where Possible

        If you integrate third-party APIs (email sending, etc.), mock them so your tests run offline and quickly.

    Automate Test Runs on Every Commit/PR

        GitHub Actions or GitLab CI can run your entire test suite (or a subset for quicker feedback) on pull requests.

    Leverage Code Coverage

        Tools like Coveralls or built-in coverage reports in Jest.

        Keep an eye on coverage but prioritize meaningful tests over chasing 100%.

    Keep Testing DRY

        Reuse factories, seed scripts, or custom test utilities for creating test data (e.g., “createTournament,” “createTeam,” “createPlayer”).

    Document Common Testing Scenarios

        For devs or new contributors, maintain a short “How to run tests” and “What the key test suites do.”

4. Summary

    Start small by implementing Jest unit tests and a basic E2E test in Phase 1, so testing is “baked in” from the beginning.

    Expand coverage as you add features—team creation, bracket generation, score updates—to protect older features from regressions.

    Integrate CI/CD so the test suite runs automatically on pull requests.

    Use a dedicated test environment for integration and E2E checks to avoid messing with real data.

With this approach, you’ll have confidence that each new feature (and each subsequent fix or refactoring) doesn’t break the core functionality your users depend on.
